MockScore is a free, open-source passion project I developed to make a simple and straightforward way to utilize powerful tabulation for Mock Trial, whether it be for junior high, high school, collegiate, or law school Mock Trial.

How to use:
1) Admin inputs team rosters for each side, number of rounds tournament will have, number of awards available, and number of judges in each trial
2) Random pairings will be made for Round 1
3) Admin inputs ballot scores obtained from judges for each round. Ballot functionality within MockScore contains support for outstanding attorney/witness nominations
4) Subsequent rounds will be made using "power matching" - in other words, matching teams with teams that have similar performance/a similarly strong record
5) If an odd number of teams exists, a bye-bust team will be created with a 0-0-0 record
6) At the end of the final round, the Admin will be able to view all standings/rankings for teams as well as individual awards. Individual awards are tracked per-role and per-side

Teams will be ranked primarily by their ballot wins. Ties in wins will be broken by win margins, and ties in win margins will be broken by total points.

The app currently does not provide a way to send ballots to judges. I recommend using another tool (like Google Forms) to collect your ballots, as this also offers greater customization in what your scoring categories & metrics are (scoring 1-5 vs 1-10, if you want other categories to be scored such as extemporization, etc.)




TO-DO:
- Make actual graphics/UI (might not happen)
- Optimize algorithm for power matching
- Eventually implement an all-in-one solution for judges to receive and submit ballots within the app (likely going to happen but not for a long time)
